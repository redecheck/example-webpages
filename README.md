# Welcome to the ISSTA 2017 Artifact Web Page Repository

This repository contains a collection of 26 responsive web pages collected from the URL generator http://randomusefulwebsites.com. The web pages contain 33 distinct responsive layout failures, including element collisions, element protrusions, viewport protrusions, small-range layouts and wrapping elements.

### How do I get set up?
Getting set up with the collection of web pages is simple. Just cloning the repository will leave you with a collection of directories, each corresponding to an individual web page and containing an `index.html` file and a set of resources (CSS files, images etc) used to correctly render the web page offline.

If you would prefer to use the original MHTML archives used during collection, they are also provided in a separate directory named `MHTML Files`.

### Contributing to the Repository
If you wish to contribute a web page containing a responsive layout failure, we encourage you to fork the repository and submit a pull request. If, after review, your submitted web page fits the scope of this repository, it will be merged into the main branch so others can use it.

### Problems or Praise?

If you have any problems with using any of the web pages contained in this repository, then please feel free to create an issue associated with this Git repository using the "Issues" link at the top of this site. The contributors to the repository will do all that they can to resolve your issue and ensure that your issues are resolved. If you find the repository useful, then we also encourage you to "star" and "watch" the project!
